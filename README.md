The project presents a visualization of a certain planetary system. 
The system is shown from the 'bird's eye' position to make it easier to observe the movement of the planets.


In the center of the system there is a star moving around the y-axis and around its own axis. 
There are 6 planets of different sizes that move in orbits around the sun, forming a spiral. 
The further from sun, the slower the planet is (each planet has an individual, constant speed). 
The system has been mapped on the Solar System, its third planet is similar to Earth with its moon. 
Both bodies move around their own axes and in their orbits. The fourth planet has two moons.



To the camera is attached to the ship, which can be moved relatively to the axis, using the WSAD and RFZX keys.
